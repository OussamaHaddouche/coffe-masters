> This project was made with vanilla js only

## Motivation

In web development, it's easy to rely too much on libraries like React. However, it's crucial for front-end developers to first become skilled in vanilla JavaScript. These libraries are all built on top of vanilla JS, and knowing it well helps you understand and use them better.

Libraries and frameworks are like trends â€“ they can become popular and then fade away. But if you have a strong grasp of vanilla JavaScript, your skills will stay useful and adaptable no matter how the front-end tech world changes.
